# Pros and Cons of Django Framework for App Development
## Pros
### Batteries included
- Use readymade packages for adding functionalities instead of writing more code.
- For example: `authentication` with auth package, `admin interfacing` with admin package, `session management` with Sessions package and so on.
- Just import these packages and start building applications in no time.
### Flexible framework
- Written in `Python`, a `versatile programming language`, Django for web development provides more `flexibility` and `dynamism` to the developers.
- Excellent support for external libraries and packages. You can easily import a package in Django without any security concerns.
- `Explicit programming` rather than implicit programming, making it one of the ideal frameworks for applications that require rapid changes.
### Faster development
- Enables faster development
- With the proper configuration, Django web development provides optimization for web applications.
- Allows developing multiple components at once, enabling rapid development.
### REST framework for APIs
- `Django REST framework` is a Python library which enables building APIs for the application, which provides powerful API functionality.
- The REST framework has a built-in API browser for testing API endpoints. Django web framework provides `authentication` and `permissions` rules to work flexibility with the framework.(https://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/browsable-api/)
- Provides `customizations` that are not supported by other frameworks like `FLASK`
### Machine learning capabilities
- Compatible with some of the powerful `machine learning libraries` like `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, etc.
- Strong `computational` and `statistical` capabilities.
- Provides `regression` and `prediction` capabilities, enabling `intelligent application development`.
