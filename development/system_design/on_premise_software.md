# On-Premise Software
## Definition
- Whether a company places its applications in the cloud or whether it decides to keep them on premises, data security will always be paramount
- But for those businesses in highly regulated industries, the decision might already be made for them whether to house their applications on premise
- Knowing your data is located within your in-house servers and IT infrastructure might also provide more peace of mind anyway
- On-premise software requires that an enterprise purchases a license or a copy of the software to use it
- Because the software itself is licensed and the entire instance of software resides within an organization’s premises, there is generally greater protection than with a cloud computing infrastructure
- The downside of on-premise environments is that costs associated with managing and maintaining all the solution entails can run exponentially higher than a cloud computing environment. 
- An on-premise setup requires in-house server hardware, software licenses, integration capabilities, and IT employees on hand to support and manage potential issues that may arise
## Key Differences of On-Premise vs. Cloud
### Deployment
- On Premises: 
  - In an on-premises environment, resources are deployed in-house and within an enterprise’s IT infrastructure
  - An enterprise is responsible for maintaining the solution and all its related processes
- Cloud:
  - in a public cloud computing environment, resources are hosted on the premises of the service provider but enterprises are able to access those resources and use as much as they want at any given time
### Cost
- On Premises:
  - For enterprises that deploy software on premise, they are responsible for the ongoing costs of the server hardware, power consumption, and space
- Cloud:
  - Enterprises that elect to use a cloud computing model only need to pay for the resources that they use, with none of the maintenance and upkeep costs, and the price adjusts up or down depending on how much is consumed
### Control
- On Premises:
  - Enterprises retain all their data and are fully in control of what happens to it
- Cloud:
  - Data and encryption keys reside within your third-party provider, so if the unexpected happens and there is downtime, you maybe be unable to access that data
### Security
- On Premises:
  - Companies that have extra sensitive information, such as government and banking industries must have a certain level of security and privacy that an on-premises environment provides
  - An on-premises environment, despite some of its drawbacks and price tag, make more sense
- Cloud:
  - Security concerns remain the number one barrier to cloud computing deployment. There have been many publicized cloud breaches
### Compliance
- On Premises:
  - Many companies these days operate under some form of regulatory control, regardless of the industry, for example, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for private health information
  - For companies that are subject to such regulations, it is imperative that they remain compliant and know where their data is at all times
- Cloud:
  - Enterprises that do choose a cloud computing model must ensure that their third-party provider is up to code and in fact compliant with all the different regulatory mandates within their industry
  - Sensitive data must be secured, and customers, partners, and employees must have their privacy ensured
