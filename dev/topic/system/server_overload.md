# Server Overload Definition
- Server Overload happens when conditions cause a server to exhaust its resources so that it fails to handle incoming requests. 
- For example, the server will no longer be responsive to requests from its email and web servers as it fails to process them, and the applications will no longer function for users.
## What is Server Overload?
- There are several factors that help the server handle its load: hard drive speed, memory, and processor speed.
- Virtual memory or hard drive space and bus speeds may also affect how the server handles the load, but neither is typically implicated in server overload.
- In many cases operations are using too much bandwidth, and in other situations the system uses too much RAM or runs out of processor power.
- When it is overloaded at any given point, it responds too slowly or not at all, and that is reflected in load speeds for websites and user experience with applications and tools
