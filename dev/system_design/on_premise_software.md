# On-Premise Software
## Definition
- Whether a company places its applications in the cloud or whether it decides to keep them on premises, data security will always be paramount
- But for those businesses in highly regulated industries, the decision might already be made for them whether to house their applications on premise
- Knowing your data is located within your in-house servers and IT infrastructure might also provide more peace of mind anyway
- On-premise software requires that an enterprise purchases a license or a copy of the software to use it
- Because the software itself is licensed and the entire instance of software resides within an organization’s premises, there is generally greater protection than with a cloud computing infrastructure
- The downside of on-premise environments is that costs associated with managing and maintaining all the solution entails can run exponentially higher than a cloud computing environment. 
- An on-premise setup requires in-house server hardware, software licenses, integration capabilities, and IT employees on hand to support and manage potential issues that may arise
