# Go and Ruby
## Comparison
| Features           | Go                                                                                                                         | Ruby                                                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Paradigm           | It is a statically typed, compiled programming language.                                                                   | It supports multiple paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural and functional programming. |
| Typed              | It is a statically typed language.                                                                                         | It is a dynamically typed language.                                                               |
| Usage              | It is used to solve both complex and simple multithreaded tasks.                                                           | Ruby is good at creating tiny commercial blogs, commercial projects and personal pages.           |
| Memory             | It has automatic memory management, which is referred to automatic garbage collection and automatic memory allocation.     | Memory allocation is sorted with the release of small sets of slots from time to time.            |
| Demand             | API or backend system.                                                                                                     | DevOps, Solutions and Services frameworks like Chef and Puppet.                                   |
| Object Orientation | Golang is not an object-oriented language, although it provides mild support to object orientation and functional concepts | purely an object-oriented language and everything appears as an object in Ruby                    |
| Speed              | faster because it doesnâ€™t need to be interpreted                                                                           | slower                                                                                            |
| Compatibility      | highly compatible when it is integrated with other parts of the software stack                                             | limited to the most popular databases                                                             |
| Syntax             | takes more lines to write the same code as compared to other C-based language                                              | follows a simple, clean syntax that is easier to read and write                                   |
## Conclusion
- Golang: 
  - Back-end systems of any size
  - Highly scalable network servers
  - High quality and speedy performance
  - Great compatibility with other technologies
  - Requires statically typed language
  - Clean environment
- Ruby:
  - Rapid result delivery
  - The quality of performance is not important
  - Testing perspective because Ruby is based on the Agile method
  - Requires dynamically typed language
