# SQLite vs MySQL: 5 Critical Differences
## Introduction to SQLite
- SQLite is an Open-Source Relational Database Management System [RDBMS] designed to work without a Database Administrator
- It is self-contained, file-based, and is known for its portability, performance in low memory environments, and reliability
- The data transactions carried out in SQLite are ACID compliant
- Most Relational Database engines are based on a server architecture that allows the program to run on a host server to communicate with processes to relay requests
- SQLite is based on a serverless architecture where any process can access the database reads and write to the database disk files directly
- Due to this functionality, all programs that are supposed to work with SQLite do not require additional setup, they just need permission to access the disk which simplifies the setup process
