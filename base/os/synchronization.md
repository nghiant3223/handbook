# Synchronization

## Critical Section

Part of the program that should not be concurrently executed by more than one of program's concurrent processes of threads at a time.

Typically, the critical section accesses a shared resource, such as a data structure, a peripheral device, or a network connection, that does not allow multiple concurrent accesses.

By careful controlling which variable are modified inside and outside the critical section, concurrent access to that state is prevented.

## Mutual Exclusion

The requirement of ensuring that no two concurrent processes or threads are in their critial section at the same time.

## Race Condition vs. Data Race

A data race occurs when 2 instructions from different threads access the same memory location, at least one of these accesses is a write and there is no synchronization that is mandating any particular order among these accesses.

A race condition is a semantic error. It is a flaw that occurs in the timing or the ordering of events that leads to erroneous program behavior. Many race conditions can be caused by data races, but this is not necessary.

Consider the following example:

```go
package main

type Account struct {
    Balance int
    Activity bool
}

func Transfer(from *Account, to *Account, amount int) bool {
    if from.Balance < amount {
        return false
    }
    from.Balance -= amount
    to.Balance += amount
    return true
}

func main() {
    account1 := &Account{500}
    account2 := &Account{500}

    Transfer(account1, account2, 300) // Transaction 1
    Transfer(account1, account2, 300) // Transaction 2
}
```

Our expectation is that, after two transactions `Transfer` finish, `account1` and `account2` has the balance of **200** and **800** respectively. Unfortunately, data race and race condition occurs and make things not work as expected.

When it comes to concurrency, that is when two transactions are executed concurrently, the snippet has data race because there are two goroutines access `account1` and `account2` that are shared memory and at least one of them has write operation without any synchronization.

The race condition is more subtle. Because we cant guarantee the order of instruction execution of two transaction, let's assume that two transaction are executed in the following order:

| Transaction 1 | Transaction 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `if from.Balance < amount` <br/> (500 < 300)| |
| | `if from.Balance < amount` <br/> (500 < 300) |
| `from.Balance -= amount` <br/> (account1 = 200)
| `to.Balance += amount` <br/> (account2 = 800)
| | `from.Balance -= amount` <br/> (account1 = -100)
| | `to.Balance += amount` <br/> (account2 = 1100)
| | `return true` |
| `return true` | |

After transactions finish, `account1` has **-100** and `account2` has **1100** in their balance, which does not match our expectation. This situation is called race condition. One may try to fix the problem using `Mutex.Lock`:

```go
var mu sync.Mutex

func Transfer1(from *Account, to *Account, amount int) bool {
    mu.Lock()    
    balance := from.Balance
    mu.Unlock()

    if balance < amount {
        return false
    }

    mu.Lock()
    from.Balance -= amount
    mu.Unlock()

    mu.Lock()
    to.Balance += amount
    mu.Unlock()

    return true
}
```

Unfortunately, this approach only solves data race, because it excludes goroutines from accessing `from` and `to`. The execution order specified in the above table may still occur, which leads to race condition. The key invariant - convervation of money - is broken.

To preserve the invariant, we have to use a better locking strategy. As long as atomicâ€™s semanatics are to end the atomic section on any exit from the block, the solution can be blunt:

```go
var mu sync.Mutex

func Transfer2(from *Account, to *Account, amount int) bool {
    mu.Lock()    
    defer mu.Unlock()

    if from.Balance < amount {
        return false
    }
    from.Balance -= amount
    to.Balance += amount
    return true
}
```

This function is free of data races and also of race conditions. Can we change it a bit to make an example that has data races but no race conditions? That is simple:

```go
var mu sync.Mutex

func Transfer3(from *Account, to *Account, amount int) bool {
    from.Activity = true
    to.Activity = true

    mu.Lock()    
    defer mu.Unlock()

    if from.Balance < amount {
        return false
    }
    from.Balance -= amount
    to.Balance += amount
    return true
}
```

Here we are setting flags indicating that some sort of activity occurred on the accounts. Are the data races on these flags harmful? Perhaps not. For example, in the evening we might shut down all transaction-processing threads and then select 10 random accounts that are flagged as having had activity for manual auditing. For this purpose, the data races are entirely harmless.

We've ended up covering all possibilities:

| | Data Race | No Data Race |
|-|-----------|----------------|
| Race Condition | Transfer | Transfer 1 |
| No Race Condition | Transfer 3| Transfer 2 |

To sum it up, data race is completely different from race condition. Race conditions and data races are not subset of one another, neither the necessary, nor the sufficient condition for one another. There are considerable overlap: many race conditions are due to data races and many data races lead to race conditions. On the other hand: we can have race conditions without data races and data races without race conditions.
