# Symetric vs Asymetric Encryption

| Differences          | Symetric                                                                   | Asymetric                                                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size of cipher text  | Smaller cipher text compares to original plain text file.                  | Larger cipher text compares to original plain text file.                                     |
| Data size            | Used to transmit big data.                                                 | Used to transmit small data.                                                                 |
| Resource Utilization | Symmetric key encryption works on low usage of resources.                  | Asymmetric encryption requires high consumption of resources.                                |
| Key Lengths          | 128 or 256-bit key size.                                                   | RSA 2048-bit or higher key size.                                                             |
| Security             | Less secured due to use a single key for encryption.                       | Much safer as two keys are involved in encryption and decryption.                            |
| Number of keys       | Symmetric Encryption uses a single key for encryption and decryption.      | Asymmetric Encryption uses two keys for encryption and decryption                            |
| Techniques           | It is an old technique.                                                    | It is a modern encryption technique.                                                         |
| Confidentiality      | A single key for encryption and decryption has chances of key compromised. | Two keys separately made for encryption and decryption that removes the need to share a key. |
| Speed                | Symmetric encryption is fast technique                                     | Asymmetric encryption is slower in terms of speed.                                           |
| Algorithms           | RC4, AES, DES, 3DES, and QUAD.                                             | RSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC algorithms.                                                         |
| Key distribution     | Hard                                                                       | Easy                                                                                         |
