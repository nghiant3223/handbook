# end-to-end encryption (E2EE)
## Definition
- A method of secure communication that `prevents third parties` from `accessing data` while `it's transferred` from one end system or device to another.
- Data is `encrypted` on the sender's system or device, and only the intended recipient can decrypt it.- Data cannot be read or tampered with by an internet service provider, application service provider, hacker or any other entity or service.
- Many popular messaging service providers use end-to-end encryption, including `Facebook`, `WhatsApp` and `Zoom`.
- It is harder for providers to share `user information` from their services with `authorities`.
- It helps `prevent` from potentially `leaking private message` to people involved in illegal activities.
## End-to-end encryption vs. encryption in transit
- In many messaging services, third parties store the data, which is `encrypted only in transit`:
    - Secures the data from unauthorized viewers only. 
    - The sender can view the information.
- `end-to-end encryption`:
    - `Encrypted data` is only `viewable` by those with `decryption keys`.
    - Prevents `unintended users`, including `third parties`, from `reading` or `modifying data`.
## Why end-to-end encryption is important?
- E2EE is used especially when privacy is of the utmost concern. Privacy examples include sensitive subjects such as business documents, financial details, legal proceedings, medical conditions or personal conversations. Consequently, failure to secure private data could result in damages to enterprise businesses and their customers.
- End-to-end encryption can help secure data against cyber attacks. In 2020, for example, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally and USD 8.64 million in the United States. These costs include discovering and responding to the violation, the cost of downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand. And in the case of compromised PII, it can lead to a loss of customer trust, regulatory fines, and even legal action.

End-to-end encryption offers more than sending encrypted messages. It can also allow control to authorize user access to stored data. A centralized privileged user policy management system provides granular control over who has access to what information. Coupled with a centralized key management system that adheres to key management interoperability protocol (KMIP), organizations can encrypt and protect data at every level.
