# Kernel

## Kernel Function

- Process management
- Resource management
- Disk management
- Memory management
- Device management
- Hardware-Software communication

## Kind of Kernel

## Monolithic Kernel

In this type of kernel, all the user services and kernel services reside in the same memory space. The old operating system would use this type of kernel. Some examples are Linux, Windows 95, 98, Unix, etc.

## Microkernel

This type of kernel is small in size, and all the User and kernel services reside in the different memory addresses. Operating systems like Mac OS X, windows use this type of kernel.

Disavantages of microkernel:

- Complex process management
- Debugging the messaging is complex
- Loss in performance because of the requirement of more software
